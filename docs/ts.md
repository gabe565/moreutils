## ts

Timestamp standard input

```
ts [format] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help          help for ts
  -i, --increment     Timestamps will be the time elapsed since the last log
  -l, --local         Parse to relative using local timezone instead of UTC
      --multiple      Search lines for multiple timestamps when converting to relative. This is slower than the default behavior.
  -r, --relative      Convert existing timestamps from stdin to relative times
  -s, --since-start   Timestamps will be the time elapsed since start of the program
  -v, --version       version for ts
```
